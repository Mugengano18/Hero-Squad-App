## Behavior driven development
- The project was asking us to make an App where the user will be able to create a hero and a squad and be able to choose any squad he/she wants to joins 
- We were asked to create classes of hero and squad and inside them create constructors and include in all the properties of each method
- We should also create relevant tests to all the classes
- We were asked to use branching
- We should also include a gitignore file
- And finally deploy it  to heroku
